                    requested by the data
                    registration process, and

                If anyone knowingly provides any information of a false, untrue, inaccurate or incomplete nature,
                Developers World LLC will
                have sufficient grounds and rights to suspend or terminate the member in violation of this aspect of the

                their child or children
                access to the Developers World website platform Services must create a "family" account, which will
                certify that the individual
                creating the "family" account is of 18 years of age and as such, the parent or legal guardian of any
                child or children registered
                under the "family" account. As the creator of the "family" account, s/he is thereby granting permission
                for his/her child or
                children to access the various Services provided, including, but not limited to, message boards, email,
                and/or instant

                Services and/or content
                provided are age-appropriate for his/her child.
