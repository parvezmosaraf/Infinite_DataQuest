          <p>Data analysis is the process of examining and interpreting data in order to extract useful insights and
            information. It involves various techniques, such as statistical analysis, data mining, and machine
            learning, to identify patterns and relationships in data that can help businesses make informed decisions.
          </p><br>
          <p>We use data analysis to gain insights into our operations and to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing
            data, we can identify trends and patterns, optimize marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction,
            reduce costs and risks, and improve operational efficiency. Data analysis also helps us to identify
            potential problems and opportunities, and to develop strategies to address them. Ultimately, data analysis
            enables us to make more informed and effective decisions, leading to better outcomes for our businesses.</p>

Some common types of data visualization include: Line charts, Bar charts, Pie charts, Scatter plots, Heat maps, Choropleth maps, Tree maps, and Word clouds. The type of visualization chosen will depend on the nature of the data and the insights that need to be gained from it. For example, a line chart is useful for showing trends over time, while a scatter plot is useful for showing the relationship between two variables. A heatmap is useful for showing the distribution of data over a geographic area, while a tree map is useful for visualizing hierarchical data.</p> -->

        <p>There are several types of data analysis, including descriptive analysis, diagnostic analysis, predictive
          analysis, and prescriptive analysis. Descriptive analysis summarizes data and describes its basic
          characteristics. Diagnostic analysis seeks to identify the cause of a particular outcome. Predictive analysis
          uses historical data to make predictions about future events, while prescriptive analysis recommends specific
          actions to achieve a desired outcome.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Benefits of Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>Quantitative data analysis involves the use of numerical data to understand trends, patterns, and
          relationships. It typically involves statistical methods such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and
          data visualization. Qualitative data analysis, on the other hand, involves the examination of non-numerical
          data such as text, images, and videos. It often involves techniques such as content analysis, thematic
          analysis, and discourse analysis.</p>

        <p>Data cleansing, also known as data cleaning or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting
          or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data. This is important because inaccurate or
          incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions, which can have serious consequences in fields
          such as healthcare, finance, and business.</p>

        <p>A correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the
          relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating no relationship, a
          value of 1 indicating a perfect positive relationship, and a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative
          relationship.</p>
